        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>
          We are a team of dedicated web developers with expertise in modern web
          technologies. Trei Feske, the visionary behind Tiger Software
          Developers, embarked on his coding journey as a zealous teenager, with
          the world of video games igniting his passion. His enthusiasm for
          coding matured in college, where web development became his primary
          pursuit. Recognizing the untapped potential in the Louisiana region,
          Trei established Tiger Software Developers to revolutionize the web
          development landscape where it's often overlooked.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          Trei's team is a testament to his journey, comprised of fellow cohort
          members from both college and bootcamp. Although spread out across the
          US, the power of the internet bridges their geographical divides,
          enabling seamless collaboration. This unity allows them to
          consistently exceed client expectations.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          At the core of Trei's ethos is transparency and open communication. He
          firmly believes in being there for his customers, quite literally at
          any hour, underscoring his dedication with a remarkable 24/7
          availability. With Trei and Tiger Software Developers, clients don't
          just get a service; they gain a committed partner in their digital
          journey.
